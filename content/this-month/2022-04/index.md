## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The next steps now are: setting up unreal mode on the CPU, loading the kernel from the FAT partition, loading the memory map, and setting up the page tables.

### [`multiboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@IsaacWoods](https://github.com/IsaacWoods), [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611), [@robert-w-gries](https://github.com/robert-w-gries), [@ahmedcharles](https://github.com/ahmedcharles), and [@Caduser2020](https://github.com/Caduser2020)</span>

The `multiboot2` crate provides abstraction types for the multiboot information structure (MBI) of multiboot2 
bootloaders. The latest release of the `multiboot2`-crate is now `v.0.13.2` (was `v0.13.1`). It contains minor 
improvements, such as that `TagType` implements `Ord`.

### [`multboot2-header`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@IsaacWoods](https://github.com/IsaacWoods), [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611), [@robert-w-gries](https://github.com/robert-w-gries), [@ahmedcharles](https://github.com/ahmedcharles), and [@Caduser2020](https://github.com/Caduser2020)</span>

The `multiboot2-header` crate provides abstraction types for Multiboot2 headers and a builder struct to construct such 
headers. The latest release of the `multiboot2-header`-crate is now `v0.2.0` (was `v0.1.0`). The changes include a 
bugfix that prevented the usage in `no_std` contexts. Furthermore, overall code quality was improved. The internal CI 
was updated to verify `no_std` builds as well as regular builds. 
Full changelog: <https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/releases/tag/multiboot2-header-v0.2.0>

### [`uart_16550`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp)</span>

The `uart_16550` crate provides basic support for serial port I/O for 16550-compatible UARTs. We merged the following change this month:

- [Remove use of `stable` and `nightly` features](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/pull/24) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.18`)</span>

Thanks to [@josephlr](https://github.com/josephlr) for this contribution!

### [`volatile`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp)</span>

The `volatile` crate provides a safe wrapper type for implementing volatile read and write operations. This is useful for accessing memory regions that have side-effects, such as memory-mapped hardware registers or framebuffers. In April, we merged the following pull request:

- [Remove the const_generics feature flag](https://github.com/rust-osdev/volatile/pull/25) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.4.5`)</span>

Thanks to [@hawkw](https://github.com/hawkw) for this contribution!

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@toku-sa-n](https://github.com/toku-sa-n)</span>

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structures, such as Registers and TRBs.

In this month, we released a new version 0.8.3 which includes [a bug fix](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/132) reported and committed by [@Yuna-Tomi](https://github.com/Yuna-Tomi). The bug was that `EventRingDequeuePointerRegister::event_ring_dequeue_pointer()` did not return the correct address. Thanks for the contribution!.

### [`rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@andre-richter](https://github.com/andre-richter))</span>

The [Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials) project
saw two more tutorial releases:

- [Tutorial 17 - `Kernel Symbols`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/17_kernel_symbols)
- [Tutorial 18 - `Backtracing`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/tree/master/18_backtrace)

The two tutorials implement the generation of backtraces that show address and symbol information. Here is an example of the of a backtrace generated as part of  the kernel's panic handler:

```
[    0.002782] Writing to bottom of address space to address 1 GiB...
[    0.004623] Kernel panic!

Panic location:
      File 'kernel/src/_arch/aarch64/exception.rs', line 59, column 5

[...]

Backtrace:
      ----------------------------------------------------------
          Address            Function containing address
      ----------------------------------------------------------
       1. ffffffffc0001294 | core::fmt::write
       2. ffffffffc0005560 | libkernel::panic_wait::_panic_print
       3. ffffffffc00054a0 | rust_begin_unwind
       4. ffffffffc0002950 | core::panicking::panic_fmt
       5. ffffffffc0004898 | current_elx_synchronous
       6. ffffffffc0000a74 | __vector_current_elx_synchronous
       7. ffffffffc000111c | kernel_init
      -----------------------------------------------------------
```

### [`metta-systems/vesper`](https://github.com/metta-systems/vesper)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@berkus](https://github.com/berkus))</span>

Vesper is a capability-based single-address-space nanokernel. This means it is aiming to be small, to provide only isolation primitives; at the same time SAS makes it a lot easier to perform cross-process operations (because all addresses are the same across all processes). It uses capabilities to provide security for such operations, so that unauthorized processes will not be able to intervene in legitimate traffic.

The kernel is in very early stages of development. This time I will update on the progress of tooling and my next steps. As usual, I will link directly to my blog for more details. [Read the full article here](https://metta.systems/blog/osdev-tooling-3/).

### [`phil-opp/blog_os`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)

<span class="gray">(Section written by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp))</span>

We merged the following improvements for the "Writing an OS in Rust" blog this in April:

- [Korean translation for chapter 2](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1101)
- [Update the code in the `post-06` branch](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1099)
- [fix: typo](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1103)

Thanks to [@JOE1994](https://github.com/JOE1994), [@QuqqU](https://github.com/QuqqU), [@ruhuang2001](https://github.com/ruhuang2001), and [@PoorlyDefinedBehaviour](https://github.com/PoorlyDefinedBehaviour) for their contributions!
