## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In May, we merged the following changes:

- [Use new `const_fn_trait_bound` feature to fix build on latest nightly](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/250) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.14.1`)</span>

We also started to [prepare a `v0.15` release](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/issues/262), for which we already implemented the following breaking changes:

- [Replace `software_interrupt!` macro with generic function](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/259)
- [`software_interrupt`: Add additional testing](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/260)

- [Change register used in setting `SS` in `stage_4`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/156) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.10.3`)</span>

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. In May, we merged the following changes:

- [Switch to the newer `Try` trait API](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/221)
- [Add `FromResidual<Result<!, Error>>` impl for `Status`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/223)

Thanks to [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp) and [@nicholasbishop](https://github.com/nicholasbishop) for their contributions!

### [`uart_16550`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550)

The `uart_16550` crate provides basic support for serial port I/O for 16550-compatible UARTs. We merged the following changes this month:

- [SerialPort::new() no longer requires nightly](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/pull/16) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.14`)</span>
- [Add support for memory mapped UARTs](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/pull/15)

Thanks to [@josephlr](https://github.com/josephlr) and [@remimimimi](https://github.com/remimimimi) for their contributions!

### [`pic_8259`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/pic8259)

The `pic_8259` crate provides abstractions for 8259 and 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PICs). It is a new fork of the [`pic8259_simple`](https://github.com/emk/toyos-rs/tree/master/crates/pic8259_simple) crate, which appears to be no longer maintained.

We merged the following changes on top of the original `pic8259_simple` crate:

- [PIC: Masks](https://github.com/emk/toyos-rs/pull/7)
- [cpuio: Use new feature flag for const functions](https://github.com/emk/toyos-rs/pull/9)
- [Replace `cpuio` dependency with `x86_64` crate](https://github.com/rust-osdev/pic8259/commit/92f7a123224e7fa1ce3813fc62b84e290d2fc799)
- [Rename to pic8259 and bump version to 0.10.0](https://github.com/rust-osdev/pic8259/commit/3e5602aaff3d30f6371c4976149eb693d5838d7c)

Thanks to [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening) and [@hanmertens](https://github.com/hanmertens) for their contributions!

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.

This month was fairly quiet, but an important regression was fixed. When native methods were introduced in March,
`AmlContext` lost its `Send + Sync`, as these native methods weren't required to be thread-safe. This meant that
`AmlContext` could no longer be stored in types such as `spin::Once`, or shared between threads/tasks. This is
undesirable for `AmlContext`, as it is very expensive to construct, and AML does (in theory) provide mechanisms to
make itself thread-safe, so any probject should only need one.

This was fixed by requiring native methods to be `Send + Sync`. If you're hitting this issue, please upgrade to the
latest version. <span class="gray">(published as `v0.13.0`)</span>

Thanks to [@michaelmelanson](https://github.com/michaelmelanson) for his contribution!

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structures such as Contexts, Extended Capabilities, Registers, and TRBs.

In May we finished implementing all of these structures and field getters/setters. Still there may exist missing. If you find one, feel free to send a PR!

### [`spinning_top`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top)

The `spinning_top` crate provides a simple spinlock implementation based on the abstractions of the [`lock_api`](https://docs.rs/lock_api/0.4.1/lock_api/) crate. This month, we released version `v0.2.4` with the following small improvements:

- [Define `MappedSpinlockGuard` alias](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top/pull/12)
- [Fix unclosed code block in doc comment](https://github.com/rust-osdev/spinning_top/pull/11/files)

Thanks to [@toku-sa-n](https://github.com/toku-sa-n) for these contributions!

### [`vga`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/vga)

The work-in-progress `vga` crate allows the configuration of the VGA hardware, e.g. switching from text-based mode to a pixel-based graphics mode. This month, we fixed a nightly build error:

- [Update dependencies to latest versions to fix E0557](https://github.com/rust-osdev/vga/pull/23)
- [Update testing](https://github.com/rust-osdev/vga/pull/24) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.2.7`)</span>

Thanks to [@ethindp](https://github.com/ethindp) for their contribution!

### [`ps2-mouse`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/ps2-mouse)

The `ps2-mouse` library provides a basic interface for interacting with a PS/2 mouse. It was also affected by the nightly breakage in `x86_64`, so it required a dependency update too:

- [Update x86_64 to 0.14.2](https://github.com/rust-osdev/ps2-mouse/pull/2) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.1.4`)</span>

Thanks to [@littledivy](https://github.com/littledivy) for this contribution!
