## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

We merged the following PRs this month:

- [Implement missing Event-related functions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/293)
- [Remove attribute to enable `const_panic`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/296)
- [Use build-std-features instead of rlibc](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/298)
- [Update `set_virtual_address_map()` to allow remapping of `SystemTable`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/301)
- [Fix new clippy errors](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/304)

Thanks to [@timrobertsdev](https://github.com/timrobertsdev), [@YtvwlD](https://github.com/YtvwlD), and [@foxcob](https://github.com/foxcob) for their contributions!

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.

This month, [support for the Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT)](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/113) table was added to `acpi`. This static table is
passed from firmware to the OS to communicate information about the state of the screen when control is passed
over, as lots of firmwares like to print display a logo when booting. <span class="gray">(published as `acpi v4.1.0`)</span>

Thanks to [@ethindp](https://github.com/ethindp) for this contribution!

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In October, we merged the following changes:

- [Enable manipulation of `InterruptStackFrame`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/312)
- [Fix docs for `page_table_index`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/318)

Thanks to [@haraldh](https://github.com/haraldh) and [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) for their contributions!

### [`multiboot2-header`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2) (**new**)

The `multiboot2-header` crate provides abstraction types for Multiboot2 headers,
parsing utilities, and a builder to construct such headers. The initial release took
place in early October and now is ready to be used. Because lots of code was published
without any in-depth reviews, further testing and code reviews will be highly appreciated.
