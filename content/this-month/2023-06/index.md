The Hermit library operating system allows you to bundle a whole OS directly with your application, creating a freestanding, bootable _Unikernel_ image.
This month, we achieved several milestones for reaching more users with Hermit:

- Stable Rust support.

  You can now compile your programs for Hermit using the stable Rust toolchain! ðŸ¥³
  
  While the Hermit targets (`x86_64-unknown-hermit` and `aarch64-unknown-hermit`) are still at tier 3, we now distribute pre-built artifacts of the Rust standard library for use with stable toolchains!
  This means, no more `-Zbuild-std`, resulting in faster builds, and the bliss of the stable Rust compiler.
  
  See [`hermitcore/rust-std-hermit`](https://github.com/hermitcore/rust-std-hermit) for details on our `rust-std` artifacts.

- Windows support.

  Thanks to Rust's awesome cross-compilation capabilities, you can now compile Hermit applications from anywhere! ðŸ˜Ž

  We have resolved a longstanding issue when building Hermit applications on Windows ([hermitcore/rusty-hermit#431](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit/pull/431)).
  The issue is all sorted out now and Windows, macOS, and Linux are tested and verified by our CI.
  

- AArch64 (ARM64) support.

  You can now run real applications on AArch64, with scheduling, network and everything! ðŸ¤¯

  - PCI now works on AArch64, which allows us to use the network devices ([hermitcore/libhermit-rs#748](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit-rs/pull/748)).

  - We merged scheduling support for AArch64 ([hermitcore/libhermit-rs#765](https://github.com/hermitcore/libhermit-rs/pull/765)).

  - You can also now chainload Hermit apps for AArch64 using our loader ([hermitcore/rusty-loader#201](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader/pull/201)).
    
    This means, you don't have to statically compile the full application into the final loader image anymore.

We'd love if you gave Hermit a try. Just start with our "Hello, World!" application template: [`hermitcore/rusty-demo`](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-demo).
