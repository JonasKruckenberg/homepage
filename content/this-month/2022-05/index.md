## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@GabrielMajeri](https://github.com/GabrielMajeri) and [@nicholasbishop](https://github.com/nicholasbishop)</span>

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

We merged the following changes in May:

#### Improvements

- [Change logger max level to be set by feature](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/429)
- [Release new versions of the crates](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/432) <span class="gray">(published `uefi v0.16.0`, `uefi-macros v0.7.0`, and `uefi-services v0.13.0`)</span>
- [Implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` for `ScopedProtocol`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/434)
- [Implement `core::fmt::Write` for `Serial`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/437)
- [Add documentation links](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/426)

#### Fixes

- [Fix an accidental `*const` conversion](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/423)
- [Fix compilation of the xtask package under Windows and add to CI](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/438)
- [Switch back to automatic `Debug` derive for `Header` struct](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/435)
- [Check table version before calling UEFI 2.0+ functions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/436)

Thanks to [@JonahPlusPlus](https://github.com/JonahPlusPlus), [@raccog](https://github.com/raccog), and [@verticalegg](https://github.com/verticalegg) for their contributions!

### [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@rybot666](https://github.com/rybot666), and [@64](https://github.com/64)</span>

The `bootloader` crate implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables. This month, we merged the following new feature:

- [Add UEFI PXE support](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/237) to load a kernel from a TFTP server

This feature will be part of the upcoming `v0.11` release. Thanks to [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) for this contribution!

### [`pci_types`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/pci_types)

The `pci_types` library provides types for accessing and configuring PCI devices from Rust operating systems. Lots of this code (e.g. identifying devices by class codes) can be shared
between projects, and would benefit from community contributions.

We merged the following change in May:

- [PCI capabilities and status register support](https://github.com/rust-osdev/pci_types/pull/3)

Thanks to [@alesharik](https://github.com/alesharik) for this contribution!

### [`xhci`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@toku-sa-n](https://github.com/toku-sa-n)</span>

The `xhci` crate provides types of xHCI structures, such as Registers and TRBs.

We merged the following fix this month:

- [fix(StructuralParameters2): Bit range in `max_scratchpad_buffers_hi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/134) <span class="gray">([published](https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/135) as `v0.8.4`)</span>

Thanks to [@Yuna-Tomi](https://github.com/Yuna-Tomi) for this contribution!
