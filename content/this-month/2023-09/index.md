### [`multiboot2`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611)</span>

The [multiboot2](https://crates.io/crates/multiboot2) was bumped from `0.18.1` 
to `0.19.0`. The new release includes the ability to add custom tags to the MBI 
builder and a bugfix when parsing Multiboot strings, such as the command line 
from a Module tag.

For more details, please have a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/releases/tag/multiboot2-v0.19.0).

Thanks to [@A0lson](https://github.com/A0lson) for their [contribution](https://github.com/rust-osdev/multiboot2/pull/172)
that helped to fix the string parsing bug.

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)
<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@IsaacWoods](https://github.com/IsaacWoods)</span>

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.

This month, a new major version of `acpi` was published, offering greater control over how the crate allocates
memory. Specifically, the new `allocator_api` and `alloc` features allow you to opt-out of allocation altogether
(allowing the crate to be used from slimmer environments like bootloaders), or to provide your own allocator using
the new (and still unstable) [`core::alloc::Allocator` API](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/core/alloc/trait.Allocator.html).
Enabling both features makes the crate behave very similarly to before, so migration should be relatively easy.

Because the `acpi` crate can now be used from environements without allocation, the `rsdp` crate has been
deprecated, and all functionality moved into `acpi`. The `rsdp` crate will continue to work, but will not receive
further updates. This should not affect users using `rsdp` to simply find the address of the RSDP, but is a
breaking change as types that have been moved to `acpi` will no longer be usable across the crate boundary.

Some improvements were also made to the `aml` crate this month, adding functionality and improving our correctness
- many thanks to our contributors!

We merged the following changes this month:

- [AML: Implement OpReg-relative PkgLength parser](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/191)
- [AML: Fix DefPackage len less than NumElements failing](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/192)
- [Prepare new version of `acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/197)
- [AML: add support for the `DefSleep` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/133001e59d3f56056d371954eb52a79ee5a2b377)
- [AML: add support for the `DefStall` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/133001e59d3f56056d371954eb52a79ee5a2b377)

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

We merged the following PR this month:

- [fix(interrupts): add compiler fences to enable and disable](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/436)
- [add `flush_broadcast` and `tlbsync` functions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/403)
- [Release v0.14.11](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/437)
- [Add `HandlerFuncType` trait](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/439)

The `uefi-rs` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS. We merged the following PRs this month:

- [Add ShellParams protocol](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/772)
- [github: Change dependabot interval to weekly](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/949)

## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`mkroening/interrupts`](https://github.com/mkroening/interrupts)
<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@mkroening](https://github.com/mkroening))</span>

I created a dependency-free `interrupts` crate, allowing you to temporarily disable interrupts on AArch64, 64-bit RISC-V, and x86-64.
Two different paradigms allow you to run code without interrupts and synchronize with interrupt handlers running on the same hardware thread (core):

Use [`disable`] to disable interrupts with a guard:

```rust
// interrupts may or may not be enabled
let guard = interrupts::disable();
// interrupts are disabled
drop(guard);
// interrupts are restored to the previous state
```

Use [`without`] (similar to [`x86_64::instructions::interrupts::without_interrupts`]) to run a closure with disabled interrupts:

```rust
// interrupts may or may not be enabled
interrupts::without(|| {
    // interrupts are disabled
});
// interrupts are restored to the previous state
```

I would appreciate you dropping by and giving it a try. :)
