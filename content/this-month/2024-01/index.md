I'd like to announce my project PhipsBoot. ðŸŽ‰ PhipsBoot is a relocatable x86_64 
bootloader for legacy x86_64 boot written in Rust and assembly. It is intended 
to be loaded by GRUB via Multiboot2, where it uncovers its main benefit: It is 
relocatable in physical memory without having relocation information in the 
ELF! It outsources a lot of complexity to GRUB which also better fits into
the ecosystem and makes it easier usable. The README contains more background 
about why I have chosen to use GRUB instead of writing my own stage 1 
bootloader.

This project combines a lot of toolchain and binary knowledge and experience I 
collected and gained in recent years about legacy x86_64 boot. **The main 
contribution IMHO is how the binary is assembled and that the thing boots
with all the properties described in the README, but not the high-level 
functionality itself.**

I am especially proud of the well-commented structure of the assembly files.
For example the whole page-table mappings are done IMHO very nicely even tho
it is assembly language. Also, I think it turned out quite cool how I configured
the linker script. I hope this can be a learning resource for others!

TL;DR: It is a learning ground and a reference for how to solve the relocation
problem with Multiboot2 and GRUB, as GRUB is not able to load DYN ELFs.

You have multiple options for testing it out:

- `$ cloud-hypervisor --debug-console file=log.txt --kernel ./build/phipsboot.elf64` (using Xen PVH)
- `$ qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel ./build/phipsboot.elf32 -debugcon stdio` (using Multiboot 1)
