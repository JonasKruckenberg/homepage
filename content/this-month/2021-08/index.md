## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.

There was a fair amount of progress this month, including adding support for a major AML feature: buffer fields.
These are objects that represent bit-level slices of buffer objects, allowing a section of a buffer to be read and
written. This requires us to support multiple namespace objects operating on the same underlying data -
currently this is handled simply with spinlocks, but we're looking to improve this situation in the future.
With this, we grew support for the `DefCreateBitField`, `DefCreateByteField`, `DefCreateWordField`,
`DefCreateDWordField`, `DefCreateQWordField`, and `DefCreateField` opcodes, as well as logic for reading and
writing `Integer`s and `Buffer`s out of them. <span class="gray">(published as `aml v0.16.0`)</span>

The `acpi` crate also saw improvement, and unfortunately some more breakage. We now support X2APIC entries
appearing in the MADT, and so have changed the representation of Processor UIDs and Local APIC IDs in
`acpi::platform::Processor` to `u32`, to support the wider IDs that X2APIC uses to support more processors. On
older platforms that only support APIC, the upper bits will simply always be zeroed, and so these values can be
cast down to `u8` when needed. Note that for complex legacy reasons, you cannot rely upon ACPI for detecting
whether a platform has X2APIC support or not, and so whether the MADT actually contained X2APIC entries is not exposed
by this interface - this is by design. <span class="gray">(published as `acpi v4.0.0`)</span>

Other changes were:
- [`aml`: the contents of the `namespace` module were made public](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/107).
  Thanks to [@Andy-Python-Programmer](https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer) for this contribution!
- [`aml`: store locals and method arguments in arrays](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/c1597aba3d39344834292637fb81e2f2971d6c04). If you're manually calling AML methods
  that take arguments, you will need to update how you create them.
- [`aml`: support the `DefFatal` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/514e55df07acbca93dfd4eb2db3cdd6fdea5aaf5). `DefFatal` will cause a panic by default, but this behaviour can be overridden by implementing `Handler::handle_fatal_error`.
- [`aml`: implement the `DefWhile` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/06409b360ef30b3b08b56865f3ee380315751f14)
- [`aml`: implement the `DefBreak` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/da5f5cec8096d2ebd5697212e282abbeaed6edb7)
- [`aml`: implement the `DefContinue` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/ed0400092e18598c73ca6048fb96b2522237808d)
- [`aml`: implement the `DefIncrement` and `DefDecrement` opcodes](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/b854d5491e48e5a4f332ff259ce185cb357261d0)
- [`aml`: implement the `ToInteger` opcode](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/00a61d8b7471dae725283296f4ee9c0c20013156)

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.
