## `rust-osdev` Projects

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

### [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@rybot666](https://github.com/rybot666), and [@64](https://github.com/64)</span>

The `bootloader` crate implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables.

We encountered various boot issues with the new `v7.1.0` release of QEMU in September. This also affected downstream projects such as [`phil-opp/blog_os`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/issues/1138) and [`hawkw/mycelium`](https://github.com/hawkw/mycelium/issues/321). After some debugging, we found out that QEMU now reports a new memory region at offset ~1 TiB in the physical memory map, which was much higher than expected by the bootloader crate. As a result, BIOS booting became unusably slow (because of the initial identity mapping) and the automated offset selection for the physical memory map ran into a panic. For full details, see the [summary issue](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/issues/259).

We fixed the issues in the following way:

- [Limit BIOS bootloader's `max_phys_addr` to 4 GiB](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/260)
- [Only perform a single TLB flush after identity mapping](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/265)
- [fix `get_free_address` for large sizes (0.10)](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/263) <span class="gray">(published as `0.10.13`)
- [allow allocating more than one level 4 entry (0.9)](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/264)  <span class="gray">(published as `0.9.23`)

Thanks to [@hawkw](https://github.com/hawkw) and [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) for these contributions!

We also brought the [upcoming `v0.11` release](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/232) even closer to the finish line. Thanks to an extensive review of [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13), we found and fixed multiple remaining issues. Also thanks to [@asensio-project](https://github.com/asensio-project) and [@TheBotlyNoob](https://github.com/TheBotlyNoob) for testing the new version and reporting bugs! Some notable changes are:

- [Allocate kernel as normal UEFI loader data](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/08e4b5829bf5882d9d396e641e32b65de72704b2)
- [Preserve `RUNTIME_SERVICES_*` memory regions](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/667e57f552e214f9c19848306e03b00d91a8114f)
- [Update usage instructions and architecture description in README](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/454f70740df13107d4748d63b1d646f176f6fa62)

### [Theseus OS](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus)

<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [Kevin Boos](https://www.theseus-os.com/kevinaboos/) ([@kevinaboos](https://github.com/kevinaboos)))</span>

Theseus is a safe-language OS written from scratch in Rust that is in the process of migrating from pure academic research objectives to more general usability and legacy compatibility.
As a fully open-source project, we welcome and encourage contributions from everyone!

Since our [last update](https://rust-osdev.com/this-month/2022-07/index.html#theseus-os) here two months ago, we have worked on the following things:
* Continued our port of Rust `std` to Theseus
    * Follow our progress in [this tracking issue](https://github.com/theseus-os/rust/issues/12)
    * Completed: [environment variables](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/581), [RNGs](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/582) 
    * In progress: timekeeping, proper virtual filesystem implementation, raw synchronization primitives
* Began adding support for the `aarch64` ARM architecture to Theseus
    * Still an early work-in-progress
* [Redesigned our Local APIC implementation](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/592) to avoid unnecessary conditionals and panics
    * Now the abstraction of functionality across xAPIC and x2APIC is cleaner
* Only disable preemption, not interrupts, during sensitive task management functions
    * Introduced a [safe abstraction for a preemption-disabling guard type](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/595)
    * Added a [preemption-safe `Mutex` and `RwLock` implementation](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/627)
    * We now use preemption-safe guards for [task switching](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/603), [task lifecycle/cleanup functions](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/616), and [runqueue management](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/629)
* Improved task management functions to expediently clean up existed tasks
    * Introduced a clear concept of a [post-context switch action](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/600)
        * Guarantees that the post-context switch action will *always* occur, even when switching to a brand new task or switching away from an exited task
    * Clarified the [ownership of the next task's `TaskRef` during a task switch](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/630), ensuring that it is dropped at the right time to avoid delays in its cleanup
    * Ensured that [orphaned tasks are properly reaped](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/614) via the `JoinableTaskRef` type
* [Avoided using `lazy_static` where possible](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/605) in favor of plain `const` expressions
    * Rust's `const_btree_new` nightly feature allows `BTree::new()` to be `const`
    * Also [contributed a PR to the `rangemap` crate](https://github.com/jeffparsons/rangemap/pull/52) such that it can optionally use that new feature
        * This makes it [faster to access and generate TLS data images](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/606) for new Task creation in Theseus
* Refactored all interrupt handlers into a more conventional design
    * Previously, the single `interrupts` crate would statically register device-specific interrupt handlers
    * Now, each device crate dynamically registers their interrupt handlers with the `interrupts` crate when they initialize themselves
        * Examples: PS2 [mouse](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/5423124bd54003c015ec66b68c797d1a7686b550), [keyboard](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/commit/0bebdc1c9a2e058ed50f09313968a6eaf1b4fec2), [ATA disks](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/611), 
    * The original design favored explicit dependencies from `interrupts` to `<device crate>` for predictable behavior over dynamically-registered states, but causes problems with inverted and cyclic dependencies
* Introduced `clippy` CI action and [addressed most lint warnings](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/issues/526)
    * `rustfmt` is next, with the hope of standardizing our code base
