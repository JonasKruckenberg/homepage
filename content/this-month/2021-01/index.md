## Showcase

We started a new [_Showcase_](https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/) section this month, where we introduce and present interesting Rust OSDev projects. The first post of this section is:

- [The `RustyHermit` Unikernel](https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/hermit/) written by [@stlankes](https://github.com/stlankes)

If you like to present your project too, just let us know!

## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about


### [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader)

The `bootloader` crate implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables. While we didn't merge any commits to our `main` branch this month, we made good process on the [UEFI rewrite](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/130):

- [Update uefi crate to v0.7.0](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/06f41a28c3227ea28e3d99c12237461b92130d07)
- [Add bootloader version to boot info](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/0c33cec02a897585bf21d21bac5e1e72854b0a18)
- [Make boot info FFI-safe](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/86d1db72fd334e34dcfc17c78540b8365a974199)
- [Start providing API docs for all public items](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/92b069a3414f423789e9921107120c7231608360)
- [Add a test that checks boot info values](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/dc1267b73faeb40fd0ee33f03331f3439f545b34)
- [Create FAT file system image from `.efi` image](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/2ac0c8260ca2838ec461ea3a390a383f3cc82958)
- [Create a GPT disk image with an UEFI boot partition](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/c7828d311f25acc4b9929ce80aadbea197cf5dd0)
- [Only copy first level 4 entry to bootloader page table](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/14c4e62adb6e05128755646d7fd5f6990a2385c9)


### [`acpi`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi)

The `acpi` repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables â€“ data structures that the firmware of modern
computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS. In Januar, we added some updates to the `aml` crate:

- [Parse DefNoop](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/8b5b45795be895eab21a8c5b23978a0c4ce8f11f)
- [Parse DefBreakPoint](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/e4b49be7befca30dcc53b6b1a0c78793e928941a)
- [Implement DefAdd](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/2fec65aacf5ddc962c87274561f764beb4c69b33)
- [Fix lack of store in DefAnd](https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/commit/501b18023cc8c1f9ae0739ed5075df3ba9861b83)

### [`uart_16550`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550)

The `uart_16550` crate provides basic support for serial port I/O for 16550-compatible UARTs. The crate received the following maintenance update in January:

- [Use stabilized `hint::spin_loop` instead of deprecated `atomic::spin_loop_hint`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uart_16550/commit/cd497a98dabc66ba151218451d07f856950d443d)


### [`cargo-xbuild`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild)

The `cargo-xbuild` project provides `cargo` command wrappers to cross-compile the sysroot crates `core` and `alloc`. This month, we fixed an error that occurred in combination with the `XARGO_RUST_SRC` environment variable:

- [Ensure copied Cargo.lock is writable](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild/pull/98) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.6.5`)</span>

Thanks to [@astro](https://github.com/astro) for this contribution!

Even though we still maintain the `cargo-xbuild` crate, we recommend switching to cargo's own `build-std` feature that is always up-to-date with the latest Rust/Cargo changes. We wrote a short guide on how to switch to it, which is available [in our Readme](https://github.com/rust-osdev/cargo-xbuild#alternative-the-build-std-feature-of-cargo).

### [`rusty-hermit`](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-hermit)

RustyHermit is a unikernel targeting a scalable and predictable runtime for high-performance and cloud computing.
This month, we revise the paravirtualized network driver (virtio) and add a simple driver for RTL8139, which Qemu is able to emulate.
With the support of [KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.io), Kubernetes is able to orchestrate RustyHermit applications.
As [simple show](https://rusty-hermit.k8s.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/) case is explained in [RustyHermit's wiki](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit/wiki/RustyHermit-on-K8S).

Thanks to [@tlambertz](https://github.com/tlambertz) and [@mustermeiszer](https://github.com/mustermeiszer) for the contribution!
## Personal Projects

In this section, we describe updates to personal projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`phil-opp/blog_os`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)

#### Third Edition

As I already mentioned in the previous posts, I'm working on a new 3rd edition of the blog. The new edition will be compatible with UEFI, use a pixel-based framebuffer, and utilize the APIC instead of the legacy PIC for interrupt handling.

As mentioned above, we added support for UEFI disk image creation to the new `bootloader` version this month. This made it finally possible to start the rewritten `blog_os` code in UEFI mode on real hardware:

![Photo of the laptop display, showing some text output](blog-os-uefi.jpg)

This is an old Acer TravelMate laptop of mine, booting from a USB stick. The output shows that it successfully sets up the local and IO-APIC for interrupt handling and then listens for timer and keyboard interrupts, just as before. The screen output is now based on a pixel-based framebuffer, using the [`font8x8`](https://docs.rs/font8x8/0.2.7/font8x8/) crate for simple font rendering. The memory management code required almost no changes, since the interface provided by the bootloader stayed almost the same (there are only some differences in the memory map format).
