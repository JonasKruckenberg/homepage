### [Experimental feature gate proposal `interoperable_abi`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/105586)

This Rust language proposal suggests to create a new `extern "interop"` ABI as a strict superset of the C ABI.
The goal of this new ABI is to "define a standard way to make calls across high-level languages, passing high-level data types, without dropping to the lowest common denominator of C".
For example, it will define a specific memory representation for strings, tuples, and common standard library types such as `Option` and `Result`.

This new ABI would be very useful for operating system development because there are often multiple executables that need to communicate with each other using a stable ABI.
For example, user-space programs communicate with the kernel using [system calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call), and with other programs using different forms of [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication).
With new `extern "interop"` ABI, these communication boundaries could use safe, higher-level types when both sides are written in Rust.

### [`default_alloc_error_handler` has been stabilized](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/102318)

On `no_std` targets, enabling `alloc` requires providing an OOM (out-of-memory) handler. The usual implementation of this handler just panics, but implementing the handler requires an unstable feature: [`alloc_error_handler`]. The newly-stabilized `default_alloc_error_handler` automatically provides an OOM handler that panics if no custom handler is implemented. This is an [important step towards using some targets on the stable channel][towards-stable].

## Announcements, News, and Blog Posts

<!--
Here we collect news, blog posts, etc. related to OS development in Rust.

- [Linux 6.1 Released With MGLRU, Initial Rust Code](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.1-Released)
- [Kernel/Boot: Cope with a Relocation by a Bootloader in 32-bit x86 Assembly Code](https://phip1611.de/blog/kernel-boot-cope-with-a-relocation-by-a-bootloader-in-32-bit-x86-assembly-code/) \
  In this blogpost, [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611) shows you how you can cope with a
  relocation by a bootloader in x86 32-bit assembly code.
- [How Does the “File Size is Smaller Than Mem Size” Optimization Work in GNU ld for the .bss Section?](https://phip1611.de/blog/how-does-the-file-size-is-smaller-than-mem-size-optimization-work-in-gnu-ld/) \
  In this blogpost, [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611) explains what properties bring the GNU 
  linker ld to save disk space, as symbols in the `.bss` section do not need to be statically 
  allocated inside the ELF. Symbols in the `.bss` segment are expected to be initialized to all 
  zeroes.
- [GNU ld: Linking .bss into .data to Ensure that Mem Size Equals File Size For Each LOAD Segment (.bss in a PROGBITS Section)](https://phip1611.de/blog/linking-bss-into-data-to-ensure-the-mem-size-equals-file-size-for-each-load-segment-bss-in-a-progbits-section/) \
  In this blogpost, [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611) explains what steps you have to do
  that the GNU linker put's all symbols of the `.bss` section "as they are" into the binary
  so that they occupy zeroed memory in the ELF. This is relevant for some very rudimentary 
  ELF loaders that are found in some microkernels to bootstrap their initial process.

  In this blogpost, [@phip1611](https://github.com/phip1611) codes with you probably the simplest
  driver that one can write in assembly. *This blogpost is from September but wasn't mentioned here 
  earlier.*

### [Theseus OS](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus)

<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [Kevin Boos](https://www.theseus-os.com/kevinaboos/) ([@kevinaboos](https://github.com/kevinaboos)))</span>

Theseus is a safe-language OS written from scratch in Rust that is in the midst of a shift from academic research to usability and legacy compatibility. 
Theseus loads and links all components at runtime, and executes everything at a single privilege level in a single address space, relying on Rust safety for isolation and correctness.

As a fully open-source project, we welcome and encourage contributions from everyone!

Since our [last update](https://rust-osdev.com/this-month/2022-09/index.html#theseus-os) here a few months ago, we have worked on the following things:
* Introduced `dreadnought`, a basic async executor that brings Rust's `async`/`await` syntax to Theseus
    * Usable by both applications and low-level kernel components
    * Integrated the concept of wakers with Theseus's native task subsystem
    * Currently, there is a 1-to-1 relationship between async `dreadnought` tasks and native Theseus tasks
* Rewrote our networking interface to offer better, simpler, and cleaner abstractions
    * It now supports the latest `smoltcp` version, `0.8`
* Added support for booting Theseus on UEFI
    * Previously, Theseus could boot from only multiboot2-compliant bootloaders using legacy BIOS
    * UEFI on x86_64 now successfully boots after significant redesign of early bootstrap routines
    * New custom `uefi_loader` tool, loosely based on the rust-osdev org's `bootloader` project
    * Early graphical display for basic text printing is a work-in-progress
    * UEFI is required to boot Theseus on aarch64; this is also a work-in-progress
* Almost completed porting core subsystems to aarch64
    * Bootstrap and logging over UART
    * Memory management: page table modification, arch-agnostic PTE flags and basic memory types, etc
    * Basic context switching and task bootstrap
    * SMP multicore, plus identification of CPU cores
    * Interrupt handling via GIC
* Redesigned the drivers for PS/2 controller, keyboard, and mouse in an intralingual manner that fully leverages Rust's strong type system.  
* Started implementing a brand new graphics stack and window manager, `Porthole`, from scratch
    * Added support for x86's Page Attribute Table, which allows Theseus to control the caching properties of individual memory pages
    * We now map graphics video memory as *write-combining* instead of cache-disabled, which significantly improves performance
* Redesigned task management to give arbitrary tasks fewer privileges
    * Two new types: `JoinableTaskRef` and `ExitableTaskRef`
        * `JoinableTaskRef` is similar to `std::task::JoinHandle`, but is fully safe
            * Ensures that a task can only be `join`ed by the "parent" task that spawned it
            * Remove distinction between `join`ing a task and obtaining its `ExitValue`
            * Automatically reaps "orphan" tasks that are no longer joinable
        * `ExitableTaskRef` statically ensures that only a task itself can mark itself as exited
            * Now, a given task can no longer invalidly mark another arbitrary task as exited
    * Refactored scheduler and task switching to not hold any `TaskRef`s during a context switch
        * Ensures that exited tasks are dropped and cleaned up expediently
    * Native ELF Thread-Local Storage (TLS) variables are used to store the current task
        * Accessing the current task is much faster, albeit slightly more complicated to initialize
* Implemented a new shell called `hull`, plus new terminal, console, and TTY components
    * Theseus can now run headlessly, e.g., interactively over a serial port instead of via a graphical display. 
* Removed usage of `owning_ref`, a crate with unsoundness, in favor of our own types:
    * `BorrowedMappedPages<T>`: a pseudo-self-referential type that allows persistent, efficient borrowing of a `MappedPages` memory region as a specific type `T`
        * Accepts a `Mutability` type parameter for either immutable (`&T`) or mutable (`&mut T`) borrowing 
        * Sister type `BorrowedSliceMappedPages` also supports dynamically-sized slices, i.e., `&[T]` and `&mut [T]`
        * Much more efficient than `owning_ref` because `MappedPages` is always pinned in memory, avoiding the need for `Box` allocation
    * `dereffer`: a new library crate that provides `DerefsTo<T>`, a generic wrapper type that allows the enclosed object `T` to be arbitrarily dereferenced to *any* inner type reachable from that object `T`
        * Supports much more arbitrary and complex deref functions than `std::ops::Deref`
* Canonicalized the content of Theseus's `x86_64-unknown-theseus` target spec
    * Codegen flags are now moved into the target spec, making out-of-tree builds easier and more repeatable
    * Target specs are now ready to be upstreamed into `rustc` as built-in targets
* `owned_borrowed_trait`: a new library crate that abstracts over Owned values vs. Borrowed refs
    * Uses traits and marker types instead of the existing enum-based designs (like `Cow`)
    * Doesn't require `Clone` or care about any characteristics of the inner type `T`
    * Allows you to use generics and associated `const`s to conditionally branch based on whether an owned value or borrowed reference was passed into a function
    * Allows you to return a different (generic) type from a function based on whether an owned value or borrowed reference was passed in

### [`Andy-Python-Programmer/Aero`](https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer/aero)

<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@Andy-Python-Programmer](https://github.com/Andy-Python-Programmer))</span>

Aero is a new modern, experimental, unix-like operating system following the monolithic kernel design. Supporting modern PC features such as long mode, 5-level paging, and SMP (multicore), to name a few. 

This month, Aero successfully managed to get [`mesa-demos`](https://github.com/freedesktop/mesa-demos) and [`alacritty`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) running.
