## Project Updates

In this section, we give an overview of notable changes to the projects hosted under the [`rust-osdev`] organization.

[`rust-osdev`]: https://github.com/rust-osdev/about

### [`uefi-rs`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@GabrielMajeri](https://github.com/GabrielMajeri) and [@nicholasbishop](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/nicholasbishop)</span>

The `uefi` crate provides safe and performant wrappers for [UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface), the successor to the BIOS.

One of the pain points of developers building software using `uefi-rs` has been the `Completion` type, which is like an expanded `Result` type which also handles warnings (besides successes and errors). There's an [open proposal](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/issues/360) to drop this type and revert to using more standard `Result`s everywhere, by treating all warnings as errors. Initial feedback suggests that such a change would be beneficial to the project, but comments and suggestions are welcome on the linked issue.

We merged the following changes in February:

- [Run tests on AArch64 VM in CI](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/353)
- [Add IA32 target to `xtask` and test it in CI](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/354)
- [Fix links in project template `README` file](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/356)
- [Remove `CStr16::as_string`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/357)
- [Fix status code check at end of VM test](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/355)

- [Add a `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/369)
- [Add minimal test for `LoadedImage` protocol](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/370)
- [Fix `ProtocolsPerHandle` internal slice property](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/374)
- [Update changelog for file info changes](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/373)
- [Make the load options API on `LoadedImage` protocol safer](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/375)
- [Switch all packages to the 2021 edition](https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/pull/376)

### [`x86_64`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@josephlr](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/josephlr), [@Freax13](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/Freax13), and [@rybot666](https://github.com/orgs/rust-osdev/people/rybot666)</span>

The `x86_64` crate provides various abstractions for `x86_64` systems, including wrappers for CPU instructions, access to processor-specific registers, and abstraction types for architecture-specific structures such as page tables and descriptor tables.

In February, we merged the following pull requests:

- [Remove external assembly](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/343)
- [Implement `core::iter::Step` for `VirtAddr` and `Page`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/342)
- [Make fields of `VirtAddrNotValid` and `PhysAddrNotValid` public](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/340)
- [Fix: `VirtAddrNotValid` and `PhysAddrNotValid` should contain the whole address](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/347)

We also merged a few breaking changes, which will be part of the upcoming `v0.15` release:

- [Merge latest changes from `master` into `next` and migrate code](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/338)
- [Make `Cr2::read` return a result](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/335)
- [Remove `external_asm` and `inline_asm` features](https://github.com/rust-osdev/x86_64/pull/345)

### [`bootloader`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp), [@rybot666](https://github.com/rybot666), and [@64](https://github.com/64)</span>

The `bootloader` crate implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables.

We merged the following changes this month:

- [Add ASLR](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/221)
- [`maybe_uninit_extra` is no longer feature-gated](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/222) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.10.12`)</span>
- [[v0.9] Remove the `asm` and `global_asm` features, which are now stable](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/227) <span class="gray">(published as `v0.9.22`)</span>

Thanks to [@Freax13](https://github.com/Freax13) and [@kennystrawnmusic](https://github.com/kennystrawnmusic) for their contributions!

We also pushed a [big restructuring](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/commit/8fb5eff0de2f776979271b771e78c94af752135e) to the [`next`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/tree/next) branch, which will become the `v0.11` version eventually. The branch is still in an experimental state and not documented yet, so it's probably a bit early to try it out. But we are making good progress!

### [`vga`](https://github.com/rust-osdev/vga)

<span class="maintainers">Maintained by [@RKennedy9064](https://github.com/RKennedy9064)</span>

The work-in-progress `vga` crate allows the configuration of the VGA hardware, e.g. switching from text-based mode to a pixel-based graphics mode. This month, we merged the following pull request:

- [Set color palette to standard 256 VGA palette](https://github.com/rust-osdev/vga/pull/26)

Thanks to [@clavierpaul](https://github.com/clavierpaul) for this contribution!

## Other Projects

In this section, we describe updates to Rust OS projects that are not directly related to the `rust-osdev` organization. Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/rust-osdev/homepage/pulls) with the updates of your OS project for the next post.

### [`phil-opp/blog_os`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os)

<span class="maintainers">(Section written by [@phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp))</span>

We merged two fixes for the _Writing an OS in Rust_ blog this month:

- [Fix link to MS Docs](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1077)
- [Fix typo in `02-minimal-rust-kernel`](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/pull/1080)

Thanks to [@kITerE](https://github.com/kITerE) and [@MaxDesiatov](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov) for these contributions!

I'm also still working on the third edition of the blog. The current state is the following:

- This month, cargo finally gained [support for artifact dependencies](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9992), which is a feature that I plan to use for the edition. There are still a few issues with it, for example [a panic in combination with `-Zbuild-std`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10444) and that there is currently no way to enable `-Zbuild-std=core` for an artifact dependency without enabling it globally.
- The upcoming `v0.11` version of the `bootloader` crate is already finished for the UEFI part. I'm still working on the BIOS implementation, which is more difficult unfortunately.
