<p>The <code>bootloader</code> crate implements a custom Rust-based bootloader for easy loading of 64-bit ELF executables.</p>
<p>This month, we finally finished the new BIOS boot implementation for the <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/pull/232">upcoming <code>v0.11</code> release</a>. It's now almost completely written in Rust (instead of assembly), which should make further improvements much easier.</p>

<p>All the tests are passing now, so we only need to do some cleanup and write proper documentation, then we should be ready to publish an alpha release for testing.</p>
<h3 id="linked-list-allocator"><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator"><code>linked-list-allocator</code></a></h3>
<p><span class="maintainers">Maintained by <a href="https://github.com/phil-opp">@phil-opp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jamesmunns">@jamesmunns</a></span></p>
<p>The <code>linked-list-allocator</code> crate provides a basic <code>no_std</code> allocator that builds a linked list from freed memory blocks and thus needs no additional data structures.</p>
<p>In August, <a href="https://github.com/evanrichter">Evan Richter</a> discovered a <em>vulnerability in <code>Heap::extend</code></em> that could lead to out-of-bound writes. The issue occurred when <code>extend</code> was called with a size smaller than <code>size_of::&lt;usize&gt; * 2</code>, i.e., a size too small to store the metadata for the new memory region.</p>
<p>Upon investigating this issue, we found several similar issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializing a heap with a size smaller than <code>size_of::&lt;usize&gt; * 3</code> could result in an out-of-bounds write too.</li>
<li>Calling <code>extend</code> on an uninitialized heap could also result in an out-of-bounds write.</li>
<li>Calling <code>extend</code> on a heap whose size is not a multiple of the size of two <code>usize</code>s resulted in unaligned writes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We created a <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j">security advisory</a> with more details and released a fix in <code>v0.10.2</code>, with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initialization functions now panic if the given size is not large enough to store the necessary metadata. Depending on the alignment of the heap bottom pointer, the minimum size is between <code>2 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code> and <code>3 * size_of::&lt;usize&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>extend</code> method now panics when trying to extend an uninitialized heap.</li>
<li>Extend calls with a size smaller than <code>size_of::&lt;usize&gt;() * 2</code> are now buffered internally and not added to the list directly. The buffered region will be merged with future <code>extend</code> calls.</li>
<li>The <code>size()</code> method now returns the <em>usable</em> size of the heap, which might be slightly smaller than the <code>top() - bottom()</code> difference because of alignment constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/evanrichter">@evanrichter</a> for reporting this vulnerability and working with us on a fix.</p>
<h3 id="xhci"><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci"><code>xhci</code></a></h3>
<p><span class="maintainers">Maintained by <a href="https://github.com/toku-sa-n">@toku-sa-n</a></span></p>
<p>The <code>xhci</code> crate provides types of xHCI structures, such as Registers and TRBs.</p>
<p>We merged the following changes this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/143">Rename <code>InterruptRegisterSet</code> to <code>InterrupterRegisterSet</code></a> <span class="gray">(<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/144">published as <code>0.8.7</code></a>)</span></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/142">Allow updating single fields of InterrupterRegisterSet</a> <span class="gray">(<a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/xhci/pull/145">published as <code>0.9.0</code></a>)</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="maintainers">Maintained by <a href="https://github.com/IsaacWoods">@IsaacWoods</a></span></p>
<p>The <code>pci_types</code> library provides types for accessing and configuring PCI devices from Rust operating systems.</p>
<p>We merged the following change in August:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/pci_types/pull/6">64-bit <code>BAR</code> clarification</a></li>

<p>The <code>acpi</code> repository contains crates for parsing the ACPI tables – data structures that the firmware of modern computers use to relay information about the hardware to the OS.</p>
<p>We merged the following changes this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi/pull/121">fix <code>HpetInfo::num_comparators</code></a></li>

<p><span class="maintainers">(Section written by <a href="https://github.com/drzewiec">@drzewiec</a>)</span></p>
<p>It's been a while since my last project update! That's partly because life has been busy, but also because this update concerns a huge feature. I'm very pleased to report that I have been able to add preemptive multitasking to CelOS.</p>
<p>This was feature that took a good bit of foundation to be able to implement (hence why it took me so long). I had to spend a good bit of time getting memory allocation (both physical and virtual) into a happier place, as well as add support for ACPI and the APIC. And, of course, there were many snags along the way as I learned (at least some of) the traps that are easy to step into when doing something as delicate as context switching.</p>
<p>Now that I have finished this key feature, I plan to work on setting up the other infrastructure needed to begin writing services in userspace (such as message passing and synchronization primitives). And, hopefully soon, finally make the jump into ring 3!</p>
<p>As always, many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/phil-opp">@phil-opp</a> for his hard work on supporting the Rust osdev community, and for writing the <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/apic">apic</a> crate which helped serve as a sanity check while I wrote my own driver for the IOAPIC and LAPIC. Thanks as well to the maintainers of the excellent <a href="https://github.com/rust-osdev/acpi">acpi</a> crate, you guys are doing incredible work out there!</p>
<h3 id="blog-post-gnu-ld-discards-section-containing-code-section-flags-in-assembly-are-important">Blog Post: GNU ld Discards Section Containing Code – Section Flags in Assembly are Important</h3>
<p><span class="maintainers">(Section written by <a href="https://github.com/phip1611">@phip1611</a>)</span></p>
<p>In late August/early September, I encountered problems when building my Rust kernel. I faced
unintuitive interaction between my global assembly code and the linker. I specified a custom
section in assembly with executable code with <code>.section .bootcode</code>. The linker never linked
the code where I specified it in my linker script. It's address was not what it is supposed to be.
<code>readelf</code> didn't show the section inside the binary either. The section was discarded no matter
how hard I tried to modify the linker, thus, <code>KEEP((.bootcode));</code> also didn't work. An experienced
colleague ensured me that my linker script is correct.</p>
<p>Section names such as <code>.init</code> or <code>.text.bootcode</code> worked by the way. Only my custom name was
rejected somehow. In the end, I figured out writing <code>.section .bootcode, &quot;ax&quot;</code> does the trick. The
difference is small, but the impact to the object file and final executable of those section flags
is big. I could find the answer in the ELF specification. A section needs to be allocatable
(<code>a</code>-flag) so that it can be properly placed in a LOAD segment/program header. The section names
<code>.init</code> and <code>.text.*</code> have this pre-configured but my custom section name <code>.bootcode</code> has not.</p>
<p>I traced it down to a minimal reproducible example that can be found <a href="https://github.com/phip1611/gnu-linker-discards-code-section-that-is-not-in-text-section">on GitHub</a>.
A comprehensive write-up can be found on my website <a href="https://phip1611.de/blog/gnu-ld-discards-section-containing-code/">Phip's Blog</a>.</p>
